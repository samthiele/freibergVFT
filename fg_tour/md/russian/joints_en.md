# Freiberg gneiss

The "Russian wall" forms a prominent cliff adjacent the Mulde river. It provides an excellent chance to examine the Freiberg gneiss, and its characteristic biotite foliation, up close. The biotite foliation (shown here in green) dips moderately to the north, as we are on the northern limb of the Freiberg gneissic "dome".

---

**Discussion point:** *Older studies of the Freiberg district suggest that the intersection angle between this biotite foliation and the epithermal veins were an important control on thickness and grade. Is this plausible / likely?*

# Faults, veins and joints

The cliff is cut by two distinctive joint sets, referred to here as "Elbe-trend" (NW-SE) and "Freiberg-trend" (NE-SW). The former (Elbe-trend; drawn in red) are remarkably extensive here, and strike parallel to the Elbe shear zone. We interpret that they are (distally) related to an important second-order dextral strike-slip fault passing below Hälsbrucke (and likely hosting the major FBa veins that were mined there).

The second joint set (drawn in blue) is broadly parallel to the epithermal Ag-Pb-Zn veins of the Freiberg district, striking NNE to NE and dipping at ~50 to 80 degrees. Both joint sets are locally infilled with quartz.

Similar relationships between Freiberg-trend faults / veins and Elbe-trend faults can be seen [underground in Reiche Zeche](./#pullapart).

-----

**Discussion point:** *Do the crosscutting relationships between the Elbe and Freiberg trend joint sets indicate which is older/younger?*

# Larger scale tectonics

We hypothesise that the trans-tensional interaction between contemporaneous Elbe-trend strike-slip faults and Freiberg-trend dilational normal faults controlled the large scale geometry of Freiberg district mineralisation.

For example, the relatively major (second-order) Elbe-trend structure hosting the FBa vein below Halsbrücke appears to delimit the northern margin of the Freiberg district and, a few kilometers to the north-west, the southern margin of the Kleinvoigtsberg district. To the south, the Freiberg district appears truncated by a similar Elbe-trend structure passing below the village of Brand Erbisdorf. Strain partitioning between these second-order dextral strike slip faults appears to have created dilational corridors, which were exploited by the rhyolite dykes and enabled dilatant fractures that facilitated epithermal fluid flow and Ag-Pb-Zn mineralisation.


![Lead, zinc and silver rich epithermal veins (green) appear to have formed in local dilational zones linking larger NW-SE oriented strike-slip faults (A). Some of these NW-SE oriented strike slip faults were later filled with fluorite and barite veins (purple). Historic mapping of the structure of the Freiberg region (B) has also identified these significant Elbe-Trend (NW-SE striking) faults.](./img/structure.jpg)
