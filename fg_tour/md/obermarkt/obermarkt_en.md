# Heart of the city

Obermarkt is the historic central square of Freiberg, and has been the heart of urban life since the Middle Ages. Surrounded by carefully preserved Renaissance and Baroque buildings, it served as the main marketplace for merchants, craftsmen, and miners from the surrounding Ore Mountains. The square’s layout reflects Freiberg’s early wealth, which grew rapidly after the discovery of rich silver deposits. Today, the Obermarkt remains a focal point for cultural events and stands as a visible reminder of the city’s long mining tradition.

## Otto the Rich, Margrave of Meissen

A statue of Otto the Rich (Otto der Reiche) dominates the square. Otto, the Margrave of Meissen in the 12th century, played a key role in Freiberg’s founding and early development - his decision to exploit newly discovered silver deposits in the region laid the foundations for the development of the mining region. 

By granting mining rights and encouraging settlement, Otto fostered economic growth that transformed Freiberg into a prosperous and influential town. His legacy is still strongly associated with the city’s rise as a center of silver production.
