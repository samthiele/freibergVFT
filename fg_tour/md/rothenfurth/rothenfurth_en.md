# Freiberg - Dresdner Gesellschaft Stolln

The strangely named Freiberg-Dresdner Gesellschaft Stolln is the final location in this virtual field trip: Just above the tunnel entrance is a well preserved / exposed epithermal vein.

However, despite the extensive clay-sericite alteration and silicification associated to the vein, it does not appear to be significantly mineralised (otherwise it would have been mined out).

Instead, the tunnel was apparently developed in ~1786 to access a structurally controlled lens of marble about 60 meters into the cliff. This marble lens is associated with one of the NW-SE striking fault zones, and was used to produce lime in nearby (no longer existing) lime kilns. Interestingly, the marble lens is also [reported](http://www.unbekannter-bergbau.de/inhalte/spot_12_011_gesellschaftstolln.html) to host galena and pyrite. See [here](http://www.unbekannter-bergbau.de/inhalte/spot_12_011_gesellschaftstolln.html) for a more detailed description of the mines interior. 


-----

**Discussion point:** *Might this marble lens be prospective for skarn-type mineralisation?*

-----

The gneiss at a second vein a few hundred meters further downstream also appears to have been extensively "dissolved" by hydrothermal fluids. This dissolution, and the extensive alteration around the Caspar Stehender vein, leads us to speculate that the epithermal fluids here may have been somewhat more acidic than those further south (around Freiberg).

# Conclusions

This is the last stop in this virtual field trip (although, we do intend to add more in the future). We hope you found it interesting and informative! 

Do please get in touch if you find errors (especially with the German translation...!) or have ideas or additions. We hope that this tour evolves continuously based on future research, community input and other local knowledge. 

To help with this goal, this trip can be [forked and edited/updated](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) via the [GitHub page](https://github.com/samthiele/freibergvft/), and changes then suggested through a [pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Please also feel free to contact [me](https://www.hzdr.de/db/!ContMan.Visi.Card?pUser=140767&pNid=2423&pLang=en) directly.
