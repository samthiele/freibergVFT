Outcrop-scale evidence for the dilatant structures which controlled ore formation in the Freiberg district can also be found in the underground tunnels below Reiche Zeche.

In this example, a NNE-SSW trending epithermal vein splays off a sub-vertical NNW-SSE trending (likely strike-slip) fault (shown in yellow). This geometry likely promoted dilation of the epithermal vein, providing a favourable location for fluid flow. Structural dilational zones like this are well known to control vein width and grade in epithermal deposits.

The abundant orange-yellow alteration (likely sericitization) around the epithermal vein indicates that this permeability facilitated significant fluid:rock interaction. Conversely, the host-rock around the NNW-SSE striking fault remains relatively unaffected (although petrographic analysis suggests some alteration of feldspar and biotite at significant distance to the veins).
