# Salty brines and fluorite

The fluorite-barite (FBa) veins formed ~200 million years after the Ag-Pb-Zn epithermal veins, in the early Cretaceous. Extensional tectonics at the time allowed salty brines to circulate through (older) NW-SE oriented strike slip faults and extension related E-W striking normal faults (as seen here), precipitating fluorite and barite to form FBa veins. 

These veins are largely free of precious metals, except where they intersect the silver-bearing epithermal veins.

Similar veins in the Erzgebirge region are also [still mined](https://www.mindat.org/loc-223771.html) for fluorite.
