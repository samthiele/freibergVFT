# Freiberg - a medieval mining town

Freiberg was founded in the late 12th century after the discovery of rich silver deposits. These discoveries sparked a rapid influx of settlers, miners, and merchants, leading to the establishment of the town around 1186. 

The city quickly grew into one of the most important mining centers in medieval Europe, contributing significantly to the economic power of the [Margraviate of Meissen](./#obermarkt) and later the Electorate of Saxony. Its wealth supported the expansion of regional trade networks and helped finance cultural and architectural developments throughout Saxony.

Mining has remained central to Freiberg’s identity for centuries: The town is home to the Bergakademie Freiberg, founded in 1765, making it one of the world’s oldest mining and geoscience universities. Today, Freiberg's mining heritage is preserved through museums, the historic “Reiche Zeche” underground mine, and a beautifully preserved medieval townscape that reflects its long and influential mining past.

## Silver strike!

Silver was discovered in the Freiberg area in the late 1160s. One tradition says that traders traveling along the old route to Prague noticed silver-bearing stones in the Münzbachtal, a valley that today lies within the old city. Another account points to early discoveries on nearby hills such as Schüppchenberg and Christoph-Geyers-Berg, just west of the later town center.

Although the exact first spot is debated, the finds all occurred within a small area and happened around the same time. Together, they triggered a major mining boom that led to the founding of Freiberg as a planned mining town. The rich silver deposits quickly turned the area into one of medieval Europe’s leading mining regions and shaped the city’s development for centuries.

## Places to visit

The 3D model of Freiberg on the right highlights several historic spots worth exploring.

**Obermarkt**. Freiberg’s main square, surrounded by Renaissance and Baroque buildings, has been the center of city life since the Middle Ages. With its statue of Otto the Rich, it remains a lively reminder of the town’s mining-driven prosperity.

**Untermarkt**. A quieter companion to the Obermarkt, the Untermarkt once hosted specialized trade linked to mining. Its narrow streets, historic facades, and nearby St. Nicholas Church offer a charming glimpse into old Freiberg.

**Wernerbau**. Named after geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner, this early-20th-century university building reflects Freiberg’s long tradition in mining science. It once housed key academic departments and remains an important part of the TU Bergakademie campus.

**Terra Mineralia**. Located in Freiberg Castle, this major mineral exhibition displays thousands of crystals and gems from around the world. Its modern exhibits in a historic setting highlight the city’s deep connection to mineralogy.
