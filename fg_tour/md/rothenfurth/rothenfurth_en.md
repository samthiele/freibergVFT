# Freiberg - Dresdner Gesellschaft Stolln

The strangely named Freiberg-Dresdner Gesellschaft Stolln makes the final location in this virtual field trip. Just above the tunnel is an excellently preserved example of the Freiberg epithermal veins.

However, despite the extensive clay-sericite alteration and silicification developed around the vein it does not appear to be significantly mineralised.

Instead, the tunnel visible here was developed in ~1786 to access a structurally controlled lens of marble associated with the "Freiberger fault", which strikes NE-SW (Elbe trend) and intersects the tunnel about 60 meters into the cliff. This marble was used to produce lime in nearby (no longer existing) lime kilns, although it is interestingly also [reported](http://www.unbekannter-bergbau.de/inhalte/spot_12_011_gesellschaftstolln.html) to host galena and pyrite. See [here](http://www.unbekannter-bergbau.de/inhalte/spot_12_011_gesellschaftstolln.html) for a more detailed description of the mines interior.

**Discussion point:** *Might this marble lens be prospective for skarn mineralisation?*

Curiously, the gneiss at a second vein a few hundred meters further downstream appears to have been quite extensively "dissolved". This dissolution, as well as the clay-rich alteration around the Caspar Stehender vein, leads us to speculate that the mineralising fluids here may have been somewhat more acidic to those further south (around Freiberg).
