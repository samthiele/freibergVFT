# Freiberg gneiss

The "Russian wall" forms a prominent cliff adjacent the Mulde river. It provides an excellent chance to examine the Freiberg gneiss, with its characteristic biotite foliation and (locally) feldpsar augen. The Variscan foliation (shown here in green) dips moderately to the north, as we are on the northern limb of the Freiberg gneissic "dome".

# Faults, veins and joints

The cliff is also cut by two joint sets: referred to here as "Elbe-trend" and "Freiberg-trend" joints. The former (Elbe-trend; shown here in red) are remarkably extensive, and strike parallel to the Elbe shear zone. We interpret that they are (here) distally related to a second-order dextral strike-slip fault passing through the nearby town of Hälsbrucke.

The second joint set (shown here in blue) is broadly parallel to the Ag-Pb-Zn veins of the Freiberg district, striking NNE to NE and dipping at ~50 to 80 degrees. Both joint sets are locally infilled with quartz.

Similar relationships between Freiberg-trend faults / veins and Elbe-trend faults can be seen [underground in Reiche Zeche](./#pullapart).

-----

**Discussion point:** *Do the crosscutting relationships between the Elbe and Freiberg trend joint sets indicate which is older/younger?*

# Larger scale tectonics

We hypothesise that the trans-tensional interaction between contemporaneous Elbe-trend strike-slip faults and Freiberg-trend dilational normal faults also controls the large scale geometry of Freiberg district mineralisation.

For example, the relatively major (second-order) Elbe-trend structure hosting the FBa vein below Halsbrücke appears to delimit the northern margin of the Freiberg district and, a few kilometers to the north-west, the southern margin of the Kleinvoigtsberg district.


![Lead, silver and zinc rich epithermal veins (green) formed in local dilational zones formed where N-S to NNE-SSW oriented faults opened between larger NW-SE oriented strike-slip faults (A). Some of these NW-SE oriented strike slip faults were later filled with fluorite and barite veins (purple). Historic mapping of the structure of the Freiberg region (B) also identified these significant Elbe-Trend (NW-SE striking) faults.](./img/structure.jpg)
