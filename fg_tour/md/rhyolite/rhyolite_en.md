# Rhyolite dykes


The Freiberg district is cut by several sets of rhyolite dykes. The older ([~325±1.2 Ma](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00531-025-02499-x)) dykes strike NW-SE, and are best represented by the extensive "Freiberg" dyke, which is near-continuous over the >30 km distance between Frauenstein (in the south) to Halsbrücke (in the north). The younger set, exposed in this old quarry near Halsbrücke, strikes approximately NNE (sub-parallel to the Freiberg vein system). 

These "Freiberg trend" dykes are especially significant, as they have been dated to [296.8±0.4 Ma](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00531-025-02499-x), a similar age to the epithermal Ag-Pb-Zn veins of the Freiberg district. The extensively altered (and weathered) host gneiss above the dyke is also notable, as it appears to have been extensively sericitised during or after dyke emplacement (it is unusual for the Freiberg gneiss to weather to this extent, as it is typically quite resistive).

**Discussion point:** *Might these dykes have been a good fluid, heat and/or metal source for the Freiberg epithermal veins?*

![Altered (and weathered) gneiss above the dyke's top contact. As the Freiberg gneiss is typically quite resistant to weathering, we interpret this as weathered sericite alteration formed (presumably) due to alteration associated to the dyke emplacement and devolatilisation.
