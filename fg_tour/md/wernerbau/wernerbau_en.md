The Wernerbau is one of the most historically significant buildings of the Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg. Originally constructed in the mid-19th century and later named in honor of Abraham Gottlob Werner, the building has long served as a central hub for teaching and research in geology and mineralogy. Its lecture halls, collections, and laboratories reflect more than two centuries of continuous academic tradition.

[Abraham Gottlob Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Gottlob_Werner) (1749–1817), one of the most influential geologists of his time, taught at the Bergakademie Freiberg for over four decades. His systematic teaching style and ability to attract international students turned Freiberg into the world’s leading center for geological education in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Werner is best known for developing the Neptunist school of thought—arguing that rocks precipitated from a primordial ocean—which sparked intense scientific debate. While his theory was eventually superseded, his broader contributions were transformative: he introduced standardized mineral descriptions, emphasized field-based observation, and helped establish geology as a structured scientific discipline.

[Friedrich Mohs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Mohs) (1773–1839), a student and later colleague of Werner, also left a lasting mark on Freiberg and on mineralogy worldwide. Mohs is renowned for creating the Mohs hardness scale, a simple and practical method for identifying minerals based on scratch resistance. This scale—still used globally in education, fieldwork, and industry—originated during his work for mineral collections and through his teaching. Mohs continued Werner’s tradition of rigorous mineral classification, helping to shift mineralogy toward a more systematic and physical-property-based science.

Together, Werner and Mohs shaped the scientific legacy that the Wernerbau embodies. Their contributions not only elevated Freiberg to an international center of geological learning but also laid foundational principles that continue to influence geoscience today.
