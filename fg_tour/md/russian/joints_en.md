# Freiberg gneiss

The "Russian wall" forms a prominent cliff adjacent the Mulde river here. It provides an excellent chance to examine the Freiberg "gray gneiss", with its characteristic biotite foliation and (locally) feldpsar augen. The foliation (shown here in green) dips moderately to the north here, as we are on the northern limb of the Freiberg gneissic "dome".

# Faults, veins and joints

The cliff is also cut by two joint sets: referred to here as "Elbe-trend" and "Freiberg-trend" joints. The former (Elbe-trend; shown here in red) are remarkably extensive, and strike parallel to the Elbe shear zone. We interpret that they are (here) distally related to a second-order dextral strike-slip fault passing through the nearby town of Hälsbrucke.

The second joint set (shown here in blue) is broadly parallel to the Ag-Pb-Zn veins of the Freiberg district, striking NNE to NE and dipping at ~50 to 80 degrees.

Both joint sets are locally infilled with quartz.

-----

**Discussion point:** *Do the crosscutting relationships between the Elbe and Freiberg trend joint sets indicate which is older/younger?*

**TODO: add Stereonet showing different joint sets** 

**TODO: add some figures outlining structural model for FG mineralisation**
