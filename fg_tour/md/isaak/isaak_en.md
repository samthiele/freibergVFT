# Halsbrücke and the Isaak Erbstolln

Ore from Reiche Zeche (and other mines in the district) was transported ~4 km north (by rail) to the town of Halsbrücke, where it was crushed and smelted. This has resulted in several tailings dumps (including the one seen accross the road here) that cause ongoing pollution of the Mulde river.

# Salty brines and fluorite

Below the surface, a major NW-SE striking vein was also mined for barite. This vein, and the smaller (E-W striking) vein exposed above the Isaak Erbstolln, are typical of the younger fluorite-barite (FBa) veins that abound across the Freiberg district.

These formed ~200 million years later than the Ag-Pb-Zn epithermal veins, in the early Cretaceous. Extensional tectonics at the time allowed salty brines to circulate through (older) NW-SE oriented strike slip faults and extension related E-W striking normal faults (as seen here), precipitating fluorite and barite to form FBa veins. 

The FBa veins are largely free of precious metals, except where they intersect the silver-bearing epithermal veins. However, as already mentioned, they were historically mined for barite.

Similar veins in the Erzgebirge region are also [still mined](https://www.mindat.org/loc-223771.html) for fluorite.
