# Halsbrücke

Ore from Reiche Zeche (and other mines in the district) was transported ~4 km north (by rail) to the town of Halsbrücke, where it was crushed and smelted. This has resulted in several tailings dumps (including the one seen accross the road here) that cause ongoing pollution of the Mulde river.

Below the surface, a major NW-SE striking vein was also mined for barite. This vein, and the smaller (E-W striking) vein exposed above the [Isaak Erbstolln](./#isaak), are typical of the younger fluorite-barite (FBa) veins that abound across the Freiberg district.

In this case, the FBa vein appears to have been used to construct an access shaft for a NE-SW striking Ag-Pb-Zn epithermal vein just to the north.
