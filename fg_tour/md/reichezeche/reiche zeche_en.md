# Himmelfahrt Mine and Reiche Zeche

The Himmelfahrt Mine is one of Freiberg's oldest silver mines, dating back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It played a key role in Freiberg’s early prosperity, with near-surface veins that were easy to mine using medieval techniques. Today, parts of the mine are preserved as a historical site, offering insight into early silver extraction.

The Reiche Zeche, meaning “Rich Mine,” developed later to exploit deeper silver veins. It became famous for its wealth and advanced mining techniques, including underground galleries, drainage systems, and hoisting technology. Now a museum and visitor mine, the Reiche Zeche showcases Freiberg’s long history of mining innovation.

# Mountains, volcanoes and bubbling springs

The ore veins mined in and around Freiberg have been shaped by a long geological history, starting with the collision of two continents during the [Variscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variscan_orogeny) orogeny, about 330 million years ago. 

Towards the end of the Variscan orogeny, the mountain belt formed by this collision was fairly rapidly torn apart by extensive [strike-slip faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike-slip_tectonics), rapidly uplifting the gneisses found around Freiberg from tens of kilometers depth to the near surface. Simultaneous heating of the lower crust caused extensive melting and the formation of several large volcanoes (at 314-310 Ma), including the Tharandt Forest Caldera to the east, and Altenberg-Teplice Caldera to the south, and the emplacement of rhyolite dykes across much of the Freiberg district. 

Sometime between ~310 and 270 Ma, heat from some of these dykes (or, possibly, deeper intrusions feeding magma into the dykes) forced metal and sulphur rich water upwards through dilatant fault zones, where cooling and boiling formed [epithermal veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithermal_vein_deposit) rich in silver, lead and zinc. The N-S to NNE-SSW orientation of these faults (and infilling veins) was determined by the trans-tensional tectonic setting, with the most dilatant structures forming pull-apart structures linking NW-SE oriented strike slip faults.  

![Lead, silver and zinc rich epithermal veins (green) formed in local dilational zones formed where N-S to NNE-SSW oriented faults opened between larger NW-SE oriented strike-slip faults. Some of these NW-SE oriented strike slip faults were later filled with fluorite and barite veins (purple).](./img/geomap.png)

Underground exposures of these various generations of faults (and veins) provide a valuable record of the post-variscan tectonics that controlled ore formation. An example of one such outcrop can be seen [here](./#pullapart).
