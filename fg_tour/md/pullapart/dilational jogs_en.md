# Pull-apart zones

Outcrop-scale evidence for the dilatant structures which controlled ore formation in the Freiberg district can be found in the underground tunnels below Reiche Zeche.

In this example, a sub-vertical NNW-SSE trending (likely strike-slip) fault (shown in yellow) zone truncates a NNE-SSW trending epithermal vein.

![The lead, silver and zinc rich epithermal veins mined around Freiberg formed in local dilational zones formed where N-S to NNE-SSW oriented faults opened between larger NW-SE oriented strike-slip faults.](./img/pullapart.png)
