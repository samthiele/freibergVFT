# Rhyolite dykes


The Freiberg district is cut by several sets of rhyolite dykes. The older ([~325±1.2 Ma](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00531-025-02499-x)) dykes strike NW-SE, and are best represented by the extensive "Freiberg" dyke, which is near-continuous over the >30 km distance between Frauenstein (in the south) to Halsbrücke (in the north). The younger set, exposed in this old quarry near Halsbrücke, strikes approximately NNE (sub-parallel to the Freiberg vein system). 

The dyke exposed here is especially significant, as it has been dated to [296.8±0.4 Ma](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00531-025-02499-x) and is noted (in historic reports) to crosscut silver-bearing veins. This suggests that at least some of the veins in the Freiberg district are older than ~296 Ma.

The extensively altered (and weathered) host gneiss above the dyke is also of interest here: it appears to have been extensively sericitised during or after dyke emplacement.

**Discussion point:** *Might these dykes have been a good fluid, heat and/or metal source for the Freiberg epithermal veins?*
