RockHopper virtual field trips should (hopefully!) be quite intuitive to navigate, but this page helps clarify how everything works.

## 3D Controls

Use the following controls to navigate the 3D viewer.

| Control |     Action     |
|----------|----------|
| `Left-mouse` | Rotate view   |
| `Right-mouse` | Pan view   |
| `Scroll` | Zoom   |
| `Double-click` | Set rotation center, or delete clicked annotation  |
| `Shift+Left-click` | Pan view |
| `Ctrl+Left-click` | Add point to current annotation |


## Visualisation Controls

**Use the buttons in the top left of the 3D view to change the view style**. The top row changes the colour mapping used to define point colour. The second row can be used to either highlight or hide some subset of the points (based on an underlying classification). This can be useful for visualising different dates in a time-series dataset, or highlighting specific parts of a point cloud.
