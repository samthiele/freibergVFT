# Himmelfahrt Mine and Reiche Zeche

The Himmelfahrt Mine is one of Freiberg's oldest silver mines, dating back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It played a key role in Freiberg’s early prosperity, with near-surface veins that were easy to mine using medieval techniques. Today, parts of the mine are preserved as a historical site, offering insight into early silver extraction.

The Reiche Zeche, meaning “Rich Mine,” developed later to exploit deeper silver veins. It became famous for its wealth and advanced mining techniques, including underground galleries, drainage systems, and hoisting technology. Now a museum and visitor mine, the Reiche Zeche showcases Freiberg’s long history of mining innovation.

# Mountains, volcanoes and bubbling springs

The ore veins mined in and around Freiberg have been shaped by a long geological history, starting with the collision of two continents during the [Variscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variscan_orogeny) orogeny, about 330 million years ago. 

Towards the end of the Variscan orogeny, the mountain belt formed by this collision was fairly rapidly torn apart by extensive [strike-slip faults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike-slip_tectonics), rapidly uplifting the gneisses found around Freiberg from tens of kilometers depth to the near surface. Simultaneous heating of the lower crust caused extensive melting and the formation of several large volcanoes (at 314-310 Ma), including the Tharandt Forest Caldera to the east, and Altenberg-Teplice Caldera to the south, and the emplacement of rhyolite dykes across much of the Freiberg district. 

Sometime between ~310 and 270 Ma, heat from some of these dykes (or, possibly, deeper intrusions feeding magma into the dykes) forced metal and sulphur rich water upwards through dilatant fault zones, where cooling and boiling formed [epithermal veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithermal_vein_deposit) rich in silver, lead and zinc. 

The depth and temperature at which these veins formed has resulted in varied ore mineralogy and texture across the Freiberg district. 

![Vein mineralogy and texture characteristic of the Freiberg district, from Swinkels et al., 2021. These hand specimens show how different sulfide and gangue minerals occur together and overprint one another in the Freiberg district. Samples from Kleinvoigtsberg, Freiberg, Reinsberg, and Großvoigtsberg illustrate repeated cycles of brecciation and mineral growth involving sphalerite, pyrite, galena, arsenopyrite, quartz, carbonates, and silver-bearing sulfides. Early sphalerite-pyrite-galena and galena-quartz assemblages are commonly broken and cemented by younger sphalerite–Ag-sulfide–carbonate or Ag-sulfide–quartz associations, with some samples showing late quartz or quartz–carbonate vein infill and cavity-filling Ag minerals such as pyrargyrite.](./img/veintexture.jpg)
